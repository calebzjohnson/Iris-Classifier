Assignment Overview:
This program utilizes an artificial neural network to classify iris plants into
three different species based on given plant information. 

Data Usage:
 - The data is trained and tested on the iris_data.txt file within this directory
 - 80% of the data is used for training and 20% used for testing
    - Train/test data is split randomly so running multiple times will yield different
      results

Model Features:
 - Simple feed forward network
 - Our initial input layer has 4 nodes since for 4 plant traits
 - 1 hidden layer with 8 nodes
 - Our output layer has 3 nodes to classify 3 species
 - The program is trained for 500 epochs with a learning rate of 0.01
    - These parameters were chosen to optimise both results and runtime
 - Implements L2 regulation to help avoid overfitting

Required Libraries:
 - Python 3 (to run the program)
 - NumPy (handles and performs numerical operations)
 - Sci-Kit Learn (preprocesses data, creates and trains model)

Compile and Run:
 - To install the NumPy and Sci-Kit, you can use pip: "pip install numpy scikit-learn"
 - To compile and run the program use: "python3 main.py" (you can use any version of python)
